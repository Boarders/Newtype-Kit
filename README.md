# Newtype-Kit

This is a re-do of the [newtype library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/newtype-0.2) based on the presentation in Conor McBride's excellent talk [What are Types for, or are they only Against?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U3lV5VPmOU). It is entirely for my own edification, however lumbering that may be.
